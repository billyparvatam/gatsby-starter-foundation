I am currently a graduate student at Virginia Tech pursuing a masters degree in communication with an expected graduation date in May 2021. I am currently working on a thesis chaired by Dr. John Tedesco comparing newspaper coverage of Kamala Harris and Mike Pence from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Virginia Tech finishing with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Multimedia Journalism and Political Science. After graduation I hope to be able to secure a communications job in the federal government, with a specific interest in working on Capitol Hill.
